## Code Overview

### Main Components

- **MainActivity**: The main activity that handles the UI interactions and initializes the barcode scanner.
- **MainViewModel**: The ViewModel that separates the business logic from the UI, handling the barcode scanning process and managing the scan results using LiveData.

### Libraries Used

- [Google MLKit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning): For barcode scanning capabilities.
- [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx): For modern Android components and architecture.

### Key Files

- `MainActivity.kt`: Contains the UI logic and binds the ViewModel to the activity.
- `MainViewModel.kt`: Handles the barcode scanning business logic.
- `activity_main.xml`: The main layout file containing the UI components.
